;; Crisp example program.
;; Author: Saul Johnson
;; Notes: Replaces every occurrence of 'foo' in the document in the file 
;; specified by the 'input' parameter and writes the result to the file 
;; specified by the 'output' parameter.

;; Every program is a single lambda (i.e. function).
(lambda (input output) 
	;; The let block allows you to bind symbols to expressions (i.e. declare variables).
	(let 
		;; Here we actually write the file contents.
		(file-set-text output (replace contents "foo" "bar")) 
		(contents . (file-get-text path))))
