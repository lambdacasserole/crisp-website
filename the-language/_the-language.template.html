		<h1>The Language</h1>
		<p>
			The Crisp language is extremely simple at its core, using the same representation for code and data. Just like in Common Lisp,
			Crisp programs are just lists that are evaluated according to a set of rules.
		<p>
		<h2>Types of Expression</h2>
		<p>
			Symbolic expressions (or s-expressions) can be of one of several different types in Crisp. An expression
			is considered <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lisp_(programming_language)#Atoms" target="_blank">atomic</a> 
			if it is not a pair or a function.
		</p>
		<table class="table table-striped">
			<tr>
				<th>Name</th>
				<th>Atomic?</th>
				<th>Examples</th>
				<th>Notes</th>
			</tr>
			<tr>
				<td>Boolean</td>
				<td><span class="label label-success">Yes</span></td>
				<td><code>true</code> <code>false</code></td>
				<td>
					The <code>true</code> or <code>false</code> keywords evaluate to boolean atoms
					in Crisp.
				</td>
			</tr>
			<tr>
				<td>Constant</td>
				<td><span class="label label-success">Yes</span></td>
				<td><code>(quote my-constant)</code></td>
				<td>
					In Crisp, calling the <code>quote</code> special form on a symbol or list will return
					it as a data structure instead of evaluating it (that is, with symbols converted to
					constants).
				</td>
			</tr>
			<tr>
				<td>Lambda</td>
				<td><span class="label label-danger">No</span></td>
				<td><code>(lambda (x) (add x 1))</code></td>
				<td>
					The <code>lambda</code> function can be used to create a callable closure. For example,
					if the lambda on the left was bound to a symbol <code>increment</code> then calling
					<code>(increment 3)</code> would return <code>4</code>.
				</td>
			</tr>
			<tr>
				<td>Nil</td>
				<td><span class="label label-success">Yes</span></td>
				<td><code>nil</code></td>
				<td>
					The <code>nil</code> keyword represents a null value in Crisp.
				</td>
			</tr>
			<tr>
				<td>Numeric</td>
				<td><span class="label label-success">Yes</span></td>
				<td><code>9</code> <code>12.358</code> <code>-5</code></td>
				<td>
					Numeric atoms are just numbers. They have the equivalent precision of a 
					<code>double</code> in C#.
				</td>
			</tr>
			<tr>
				<td>Pair</td>
				<td><span class="label label-danger">No</span></td>
				<td><code>(1 . 2)</code> <code>("hello" . "world")</code></td>
				<td>
					A pair is the basic building block of a list. It's the simplest data structure possible,
					consisting of a pair of expressions bound together in a <i>cons</i> cell. Read more about
					it <a target="_blank" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cons">on Wikipedia</a>.
				</td>
			</tr>
			<tr>
				<td>String</td>
				<td><span class="label label-success">Yes</span></td>
				<td><code>"hello"</code> <code>"world"</code></td>
				<td>
					A string represents a sequence of characters. Even though it is possible to manipulate
					strings in Crisp, they are immutable and considered to be atoms.
				</td>
			</tr>

		<h2>Crisp Is Lazy</h2>
		<p>
			Importantly, Crisp is lazily evaluated. Any values you bind in <code>let</code>
			or <code>letrec</code> blocks aren't actually evaluated until they're used in your
			executing code. Let's take a look back at our example:
		</p>
		<pre>{code}</pre>
		<p>
			The call to the <code>file-get-text</code> function only happens when we actually need its value,
			so nothing is read from disk until the evaluator hits line 12. If we comment out the line that
			actually requires the value of <code>contents</code> and replace it with a simple addition, for example:
		</p>
		<pre>{code_2}</pre>
		<p>
			Now, no data is actually read from disk because the expression bound to the <code>contents</code> symbol
			is never evaluated. This is extrememly important to bear in mind when your code is designed to produce
			side-effects (for example, writing a record to a database or a text file to disk).
		</p>
		<h2>Binding Values &amp; Applying Functions</h2>
		<p>
			To apply a function, we write a list with the symbol bound to the function as its first element, followed
			by any parameters we want to pass to the function. For example, in the following program we create a lambda
			that will increment any given number by 1, then we bind it to the symbol <code>increment</code>. In the body
			of the <code>let</code> block, we make a call to the lambda bound to increment, passing in the number that
			the user specified on the command line:
		</p>
		<pre>{code_3}</pre>
		<p>
			Now if we run this program on the command line using <code>crisp.exe -f "increment.csp" -a 5</code> we'll get
			the number <code>6</code> passed back as the result; we just incremented a number! Now head over to the
